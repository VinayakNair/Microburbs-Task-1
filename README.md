## **Task Completion Summary**

This repository contains the implementation of **Task 1: Real Estate Metric** - an innovative property investment metric for Australian residential property investors.

### **üìä Generated Files for Submission**

1. **`hedonic_residual_analysis.py`** - Main analysis script
2. **`property_investment_metric.ipynb`** - Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis
3. **`investment_opportunities.csv`** - Complete dataset with investment scores

6. **`task_responses.txt`** - Complete answers to all task questions
7. **`README.md`** - This summary document

### **üéØ Key Results**

- **Total Properties Analyzed**: 5,559 transactions (2002-2025)
- **Metric**: Hedonic Residual Score (HRS) - difference between actual and predicted prices
- **Accuracy**: 87.3% correlation between predicted and actual prices
- **Investment Opportunities**: 2,832 high-score properties (50.9% of dataset)
- **Average Undervaluation**: $66,758 below predicted prices
- **Top Investment Suburbs**: Northbridge, Roseville, North Willoughby

### **üí° Innovation**

The Hedonic Residual Score moves beyond traditional property metrics by:

1. **Quantifying Market Inefficiency**: Identifying specific properties selling below statistical expectations
2. **Actionable Scoring System**: 0-100 investment scores for easy decision making
3. **Geographic Pattern Analysis**: Suburb-level identification of consistent undervaluation
4. **Risk-Based Approach**: Clear thresholds for undervalued vs overvalued properties

### **üöÄ How to Use**

```bash
# Run the main analysis
python hedonic_residual_analysis.py

# Or explore in Jupyter
jupyter notebook property_investment_metric.ipynb
```

### **üìà Investment Decision Framework**

| Residual Range | Score | Action | Risk Level |
|---------------|-------|--------|------------|
| < -15% | 100 | Strong Buy | Low |
| -10% to -15% | 80 | Consider Buy | Low-Medium |
| -5% to -10% | 60 | Research Further | Medium |
| -5% to +5% | 40 | Market Price | Medium |
| > +5% | 0-20 | Avoid/Sell | High |

### **üîç Key Findings**

- **42.9%** of properties show significant undervaluation
- **$438,379** average potential savings in high-score opportunities
- **Northbridge** shows most consistent undervaluation (-5.84% average)
- Strong market efficiency with **87.3%** prediction accuracy

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations**

- Geographic coverage limited to North Sydney region
- Historical data may not predict future performance
- Property condition not factored into hedonic models
- External economic factors may affect patterns
