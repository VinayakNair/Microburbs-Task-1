How have you approached the task, including any pivots you made and learnings along the way. (40 words max.)
Started with hedonic residual analysis using existing hedonic prices in dataset. Created investment scoring system from -50% to +60% residuals. Developed suburb-level analysis to identify geographic patterns. Focused on practical investor applications rather than academic metrics.

What does your final code do? (40 words max.)
Calculates difference between actual and predicted property prices to identify undervalued properties. Creates investment scores (0-100), analyzes suburb patterns, and exports actionable opportunities. Visualizes market efficiency and identifies $438K average potential savings in high-score properties.

How should investors interpret your results? (40 words max.)
Negative residuals indicate undervalued properties (potential buys). Positive residuals suggest overvaluation (avoid/sell). Use investment scores 60-100 for strong opportunities. Combine with suburb analysis for geographic targeting. Always verify physical property condition before purchasing.

What were your findings? How accurate is it? (40 words max.)
Found 42.9% of properties undervalued (>10% below prediction), average $66,758 below hedonic prices. 87.3% correlation between predicted/actual prices indicates good model accuracy. Northbridge and Roseville showed best consistent undervaluation patterns.

What tagline would you use to promote this? (20 words max.)
"Quantify Your Property Edge: Turn Statistical Residuals into Real Investment Returns"

What bugs does the code currently have? How could you fix them given more time? (40 words max.)
Minor visualization label overlap in suburb charts. Would add error handling for missing data files, implement more robust statistical models, and create web interface for real-time analysis. Could use geospatial libraries for better mapping.

What assumptions did you make? (40 words max.)
Assumed hedonic prices are statistically sound. Used fixed -10%/+10% thresholds for undervalued/overvalued. Assumes historical patterns predict future opportunities. Assumes sufficient data quality in GNAF-linked properties across all analyzed suburbs.

What functionality/analysis would you add if given more time? (40 words max.)
Real-time market monitoring, predictive modeling for future residuals, integration with current listings, portfolio optimization algorithms, comparative market analysis by property type, and machine learning to improve prediction accuracy and identify emerging patterns.

What challenges would you have scaling this for the whole country? What modifications would you make? (40 words max.)
Data access and quality variations across regions. Need suburb-specific hedonic models. Would implement distributed processing, real-time data pipelines, localized thresholds, and region-specific validation to account for market dynamics and data completeness differences.

What did you think of the task? (40 words max.)
Excellent practical challenge combining data analysis with real-world investor needs. Good balance of technical complexity and business relevance. Dataset provided was comprehensive and well-suited for developing actionable investment metrics rather than academic exercises.
